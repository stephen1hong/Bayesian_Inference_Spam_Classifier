# Bayesian_Inference_Spam_Classifier
using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.
Usually they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye 
and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks.

Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. 
Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.

This project has been broken down in to the following steps:

Step 0: Introduction to the Naive Bayes Theorem
Step 1.1: Understanding our dataset
Step 1.2: Data Preprocessing
Step 2.1: Bag of Words(BoW)
Step 2.2: Implementing BoW from scratch
Step 2.3: Implementing Bag of Words in scikit-learn
Step 3.1: Training and testing sets
Step 3.2: Applying Bag of Words processing to our dataset.
Step 4.1: Bayes Theorem implementation from scratch
Step 4.2: Naive Bayes implementation from scratch
Step 5: Naive Bayes implementation using scikit-learn
Step 6: Evaluating our model
Step 7: Conclusion
